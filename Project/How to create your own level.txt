All the levels are stored as .txt files. You can find them in the "Assets" folder.

To create your own level, simply create another .txt files with the game arrangement you desired and put it into "Assets".

If you open a level file and compare it to the actual game, you can map each symbol to an item in the game.

Notes:
1. The width and length of each level is fixed; don't create a map that's too large or too small
2. The levels starts at 00 and goes up sequentially.
