Some more rules & tips:
1. All items that have health can be attacked by bullets (not necessarily player's bullet)
2. Some levels are puzzle levels; think!
3. Robots will react & move faster and faster as level increases
4. The graphic version of the rules and the level solutions are written in Chinese, stored in the "Chinese" folder
5. For all other rules, try out yourself!
