Marble Madness

This project is an individual project assignment for the class CS32: Introduction to Computer Science II

The project is a puzzle-solving video game.

On top of the class requirements, I added some more functionalities and developed 15 game levels.

The game does have an audio component, and it supports DIY levels.

---------------------------------------------

All the source code of the game is stored in the folder "Source Code".

To run them, simply open this folder in an text editor, add all the files if needed, build, and execute.

There are no external modules that need to be downloaded.

If you want to directly play the game, the executable "MarbleMadness.exe" is stored in the folder "Project".

The game rules and instructions for DIY levels are also stored in "Project".
